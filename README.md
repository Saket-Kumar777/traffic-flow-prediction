# Traffic Flow Prediction

This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for predicting traffic flow based on historical data. The project includes data visualization, feature engineering, and applying machine learning models (GRU) to forecast future traffic patterns at various junctions.
## Contents

TrafficFlowPrediction.ipynb: The main notebook containing end-to-end implementation of the traffic flow prediction, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python packages (can be installed via `requirements.txt` if provided):

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

## Results
 -Comparative plots of predicted vs. actual traffic.
 -RMSE values to assess the model's accuracy.

## Authors
