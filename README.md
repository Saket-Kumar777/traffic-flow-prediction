# Traffic Prediction Using XGBoost

This repository contains Python scripts for traffic prediction using feature engineering, time series transformations, and the XGBoost machine learning model. The project includes visualizations, data preprocessing, and model evaluation for predicting traffic flow at multiple junctions.

## Contents

- **TrafficPredictionXGBoost.py**: The script implements data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, time series transformations, model training, and evaluation for traffic prediction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python packages (can be installed via `requirements.txt`):
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Results
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - RMSE values for predictions across four junctions.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Time series plots showing the alignment between predicted and actual values.
